Triangulating a number is taking each digit to the power of 3 and adding them together.

Thus:

To triangulate the number, 92,

Calculate (9) cubed = 729 and add (2) cubed = 8 to get 737. Then,

Calculate (7) cubed + (3) cubed + (7) cubed to get 713 , then

Calculate (7) cubed + (1) cubed + (3) cubed to get 371.


//-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Father   1 = 1    
A Constant, never changing, self.

Son      2 > 8 >512 > 134 > 92 > 737 > 713 > 371 
Thus 2 is caught by 371 ( after the 7th iteration)

Trinity  3 > 27 > 351(SATAN’s Number) > 153 
Thus 3, the trinity function passes thru Satan to Finality).

Earth    4 > 64 > 280 > 520 > 133 > 55 > 250 > 133 > 55 
(therefore an endless loop- earth thus would never learn, even though grace is present 11 fold) 
Interesting that this Grace, 5, is found present eleven (judgment) times

Grace    5 > 125> 134 > 92 > 737 > 713 > 371 
(The Son, Grace always leads to Him, and after Him, never changing)

Man      6 > 216 > 225 > 141 > 66 > 432 > 99 > 1458 > 702 > 351 >153 
(man sees the Trinity only after going through Satan, the mirror image of Christ)  
This takes 10 (Law)iterations.

Perfect  7 > 343 > 118 > 514 > 190 > 730 > 370: 
(370 is an endless loop. Man (6) gets in the loop after 6 iterations, but can reach perfection 
by adding 1 (Father) to get the Son (371) , becoming (8) (new).  Man (6) can also take 1 (self) 
out, becoming 5, and enter by His Grace.

New      8 > 512 > 134 > 92 > 737 > 713 > 371 
(on the 6th (man) iteration, we arrive at 371, never changing)

Judgment 9 > 729 > 1080 > 513 > 153 
(Thus, after 4 (earth) iterations we avoid the judgment of the earth by The judge, only through 
the Grace( 5) of Christ. We can do this by adding Father, 1 to 6, man, thereby being made 
perfect, 7. Or essentially we take self 1 out of man 6, and enter via His Grace, 5.Satans 
triangular result number 351, can be seen to be temporary, and seen to be the mirror image 
of the ‘trinity function“, 153. No news here. 351 is seen to be swallowed up in the end.

Notice also that satan’s mirror image number 351 is 20 short of Christ’s number, 371. 20 is the number of Redemption.

 
Law, Testimony 10 > 1 and never changes. Thus the Law is also Eternal, and constant.  It never changes either.
